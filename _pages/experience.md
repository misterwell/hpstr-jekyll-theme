*   ### My passion is designing & building products that make the customer’s life better, easier, and more enjoyable by addressing common problems with technological solutions.
*   ### I manage teams by creating an environment where members are recognized and rewarded for their contributions through transparency, personal accountability, and continuous learning.
*   ### I believe that talented individuals thrive when they are process-driven instead of result-driven, are surrounded by colleagues that they respect, and are part of a team that continuously pushes their standard of quality upwards with each product release.
