After graduating from college, I joined Vertical Communications as a QA engineer and quickly transitioned into a junior developer role, creating & updating critical callflows for our largest customer, CVS Pharmacy. I added features & functionality to the existing scripts, refactored the code to facilitate adding Spanish language support, and even started fixing bugs in the C++ backend server application.

When Vertical made the transition to an Agile engineering organization, I moved into the Scrum Master role of the Large Enterprise engineering team reporting directly to the VP of Engineering, and managed the design & development of all deliverables to CVS Pharmacy and all of Vertical's other retail customers. I started contributing to the development of our Wave server platform while performing my LE scrum master duties, and delivered features such as Instant Messaging & Cascading Voicemail, both of which are still in heavy use today.

At about the time when Apple’s iOS platform had reached version 3.0, I bought my first iPhone, and since then my passion has been to develop solutions for these amazing devices that have entirely changed how we interact with each other and the world. I started learning iOS development through Stanford’s free online courses, and over the next 2 years I released 3 apps that have been downloaded thousands of times. Releasing these apps gave me the confidence that I could take Vertical into the mobile era, and I founded a new team tasked with creating [ViewPoint Mobile](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/viewpoint-mobile/id521890050) for iOS & Android devices, as well as the API server that became the next-generation backend for all future Vertical client applications.

At Vertical, my product manager and I made the Mobile Apps team the fastest & most efficient team there. We freed ourselves from the slow release cycle that hamstrung our server development teams by adding APIs for new client features in server releases, and then iteratively releasing client updates that kept our users engaged with new features over a long period of time. We were the first team at Vertical to utilize analytics to inform the product roadmap and design decisions, which our users have taken notice of. We championed the use of [git](http://git-scm.com/) as our SCM system and encouraged stronger code reviews, branch management, and more transparency between developers. And we led the development of a new VOIP web application using cutting-edge Javascript frameworks & technologies in order to once again change how our end-users communicate with the rest of their organization.

In 2015, I joined Hathway as the Director of Engineering, reporting to the VP of Production to help manage the engineering team to deliver incredible consumer websites and mobile applications. At Hathway, I've been responsible for growing our technology team's capabilities and expertise in order to deliver innovative solutions to our clients, expanding our team and bringing on new managers in order to effectively scale with the business, and have made our department more efficient and productive with CI/CD processes, analytics analysis, and documentation. 

In my free time, I enjoy advancing my knowledge of iOS, [contributing to open source](https://github.com/misterwell) when time permits, and exercising the right side of my brain through [photography](http://misterwell.smugmug.com/).
